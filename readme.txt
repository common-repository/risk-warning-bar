Risk Warning Bar adds a floating bar at the bottom of your website that displays risk warnings set by a wide range of CFD & Forex brokers.

== Description ==
Since 2018, CFD brokers are required to update their risk warning percentage every quarter, resulting a lot of administrative work for affiliates to keep their risk warnings up to date.
We built Risk Warning Bar to save time for both affiliates and brokerages. This plugin works by automatically pulling in the latest risk warning pulled in from the brokers' website, or set by their staff in the Risk Warning Bar admin area that they're given access to. This means that, as an affiliate, you just need to set which broker each page on your site is about and the plugin will keep the risk percentage up to date.
You can see a demo of Risk Warning Bar displaying eToro's latest risk warning on [BrokerNotes](https://brokernotes.co/etoro-review/ "BrokerNotes here").
Please note: We developed this plugin to make remaining compliant easier for both affiliates and brokers, but it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure that your website is compliant. We accept no responsibility or liability for non-compliance as a result of using this plugin.
